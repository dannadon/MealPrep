# MealPrep

This app is a personal app for the average cook. Included are some easy recipes names with a list of necessary ingrediants.
In order to add a new recipe then the user just hits the + button in the top right corner, and it takes them to a new
page to add the recipe name and the recipe itself.
The app is successfully able to add new new recipes to an archive. Once a recipe is added then the recipe will remain and pop 
back up for the next time the user wants to view their recipes. 
If the user wants to delete a recipe then they must hit the top left edit button to delete a recipe. When the user deletes a 
recipe, it also deletes from the archive and then it does not show up the next viewing of the app.

Unfortunately I could not get delete and edit to work correctly in the app.

In order to run the applications users will need the most updated version of Xcode. They hit the top right play button in the 
leftand corner. The app should run flawlessly after that.
